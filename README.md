# SkateBot 
(code is implemented in the Skate Gen android app)
Check it out at: https://skategen.app

This is a skateboard trick generator written in Java.
The aim for this project is to create a skate bot that is able to generate all skateboarding tricks including flat-ground, vert , grinds and slides, and finally "special" tricks. The bot should also be able to validate that a trick follows the correct skateboarding trick naming convention (is in the langauge of skateboarding).

The current release:

- Is able to generate +200 skateboarding tricks at random and starts to crash once I reuqest more than 250 tricks from it.
- Is able to recognize if a string is a skateboarding trick or not. It is limited by the fact that it is not able to recognize tricks that it cannot generate and the final goal is for it to be able to do that.
- Is able to generate +500 manual trick combinations. (update: 27 Jul 2020)

Future releases include:

- The SkateBot being able to generate all the flatground tricks and adding manual related tricks.
- Be able to validate all flat-ground tricks.
- Being able to generate slides and grind tricks for skater to do
- Also be able to validate given any string, is it a flatground trick or a grind/slide trick


Eventually I would like to build a skateboarding coach for a user that will help them progress using some machine learning.
